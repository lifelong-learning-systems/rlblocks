# Goals

1. maximum flexibility for researchers
2. general building blocks
3. at most 1 level of inheritance (e.g. to define abstract interface). prefer composition over inheritance
4. implement standard RL algorithms
5. reproducibility
6. supports many rl domains (continual RL, meta RL, offline RL)

# Framing

1. An RL Algorithm is a collection of things that happens at certain times
