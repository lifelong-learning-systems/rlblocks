rlblocks
===========

rlblocks provides building blocks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents.

Requirements
----------------
* Python 3.7 or greater

Install
-------------
1. Create a conda or virtual environment and activate it

2. Update pip and wheel in your environment:
  ```
  pip install -U pip wheel
  ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:darpa-l2m/rlblocks.git
   ```
   or
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/darpa-l2m/rlblocks.git
   ```
4. Install the rlblocks package and its dependencies:
   ```
   pip install "./rlblocks"
   ```

To update rlblocks, pull the latest changes from the git repository and upgrade:
```
pip install -U .
```

Example RL Algorithms
---------------------

1. PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) in CartPole-v1: [examples/ppo.py](examples/ppo.py). Run with `python -m examples.ppo`
2. DQN (Deep Q Learning) in CartPole-v1: [examples/dqn.py](examples/dqn.py). Run with `python -m examples.dqn`

MiniGrid Crossing Experiment
-----------------------------

We provide an experiment in the MiniGrid environment called MiniGrid Crossing.

The curriculum is built using the `tella` package.

Right now we provide a baseline DQN agent, the baseline and EWC, and the baseline
with task specific replay buffers.

To run the experiment run:

`python -m minigrid_crossing_experiment`

Bug Reports and Feature Requests
---------------------------------
Bug reports and feature requests should be made through issues on Github.

A bug report should contain:
 * descriptive title
 * environment (python version, operating system if install issue)
 * expected behavior
 * actual behavior
 * stack trace if applicable
 * any input parameters need to reproduce the bug

A feature request should describe what you want to do but cannot
and any recommendations for how this new feature should work.


For Developers
----------------
To install rlblocks in editable mode with our development requirements:
```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

To run unit tests:
```
pytest
```
For running in conda environment:
```
python -m pytest 
```

To check for PEP8 compliance:
```
black --check rlblocks
```

To autoformat for PEP8 compliance:
